## About Me 👨‍💻

I'm a passionate developer focused on code, open-source, and cybersecurity.
I enjoy building from scratch: shells, parsers, network services, and AI tools applied to real-world problems like OSINT and medical imaging.

### My Projects 🔧

- **42sh – POSIX Unix Shell in C** 🐚  
  A POSIX-based Unix-like shell written in C: lexical analysis, parsing, expansions, environment management, job control, and execution engine.  
  Designed to follow the POSIX shell command language so scripts and interactive use behave consistently across Unix-like systems, similar in spirit to `bash --posix`.
  
- **Web Scraper (OSINT Tool)** 🌐  
  An OSINT tool to gather information about a person on the internet: automates scraping of multiple sources, aggregates results, and helps investigations/security assessments.

- **OCR – Crossword Solver (Mots fléchés)** 🧠  
  An AI using OCR to read crossword grids and suggest answers by combining computer vision with linguistic heuristics.

- **Breast Cancer Detection AI** 🩺  
  A medical imaging model that analyzes breast images and predicts whether a woman is likely to have breast cancer or not.  
  Uses convolutional neural networks (PyTorch/TensorFlow) trained on labeled medical datasets to classify images and output a probability score.

- **Networking / HTTP & Servers** 🌐  
  Low-level C projects implementing network protocols and small servers, with emphasis on memory safety, clean Makefiles, and testability.
